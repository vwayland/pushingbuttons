            <h3> internal/external ballad song lyrics </h3>
            <p> 
            I am in love with the center of the earth 
            </p>
            <p>
            Have you seen how it glows
            </p>
            <p>
            Because it is so hot that it will burn anything that comes close
            </p>
            <p>
            Except for me...
            </p>
            <p> <br>
            Our first meeting was strange 
            </p>
            <p>
            I saw a personals ad in the paper
            </p>
            <p>
            I don’t usually look at the personals adds
            </p>
            <p>
            I was flipping to the obituary section 
            </p>
            <p>
            But the add caught my eye
            </p>
            <p>
            And then the text burned in my brain 
            </p>
            <p>
            The add read
            </p>
            <p>
            ISO very talented person 
            </p>
            <p>
            To bring music to the center of the earth
            </p>
            <p>
            Has to be good at improvising 
            </p>
            <p>
            And be especially sensitive
            </p>
            <p>
            And have better than average observational skills
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I started making the journey to the center after I responded to the add
            </p>
            <p>
            The feeling was intoxicating 
            </p>
            <p>
            The center promised me that I could be safe 
            </p>
            <p>
            That I would not burn when I got too close to her 
            </p>
            <p>
            The safety I realized was all I ever wanted 
            </p>
            <p>
            To be protected by something bigger than myself
            </p>
            <p>
            <br>
            Then the day I realized I was in love
            </p>
            <p>
            I had found out the most amazing thing 
            </p>
            <p>
            The center was in charge of all the coincidences experienced on the surface of the earth
            </p>
            <p>
            The center sent up signs 
            </p>
            <p>
            And those who paid attention 
            </p>
            <p>
            Who were looking around 
            </p>
            <p>
            They noticed her signs 
            </p>
            <p>
            They got the satisfaction of the uncanny in their lives
            </p>
            <p>
            <br>
            She told me she was lonely 
            </p>
            <p>
            And that’s why she put the advertisement out 
            </p>
            <p>
            And then I realized it was more than that
            </p>
            <p>
            She was worried about being forgotten
            </p>
            <p>
            We decided to write a song together
            </p>
            <p>
            we became creative collaborators
            </p>
            <p>
            I would wake up and write first thing 
            </p>
            <p>
            And then run music by her 
            </p>
            <p>
            She was a harsh critic 
            </p>
            <p>
            But I liked that she was serious about the work
            </p>
            <p>
            <br>
            There has never been music before in the center of the earth
            </p>
            <p>
            As this is the first song ever 
            </p>
            <p>
            It is both <a style="color: #6495ed;" href="artiststatement.html"> the least important and most important </a>
            </p>
            <p>
            When it’s done we will learn it by heart
            </p>
            <p>
            <br>
            I have fallen in love with the center of the earth
            </p>
            <p>
            I have decided to stay here, with her
            </p>
            <p>
            I am not coming back to the surface
            </p>
            <p>
            <br>
            If you hear our song maybe it will get stuck in your head
            </p>
            <p>
            Maybe you will make your own version 
            </p>
            <p>
            The more the merrier! 
            </p>
            <p>
            <br>
            And if you think you will miss me
            </p>
            <p>
            To anyone who knew me 
            </p>
            <p>
            You will still feel me 
            </p>
            <p>
            When you come across a special coincidence 
            </p>
