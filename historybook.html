            <p> I was reading this book, a history book. There was a part that mentioned a mayor, well she won the mayoral election but then turned down the nomination. But the whole thing was funny because she was the only resident of the town. So, when she declined the nomination she was just living with no government. But also I guess she was self-governed and anyway she made it into this history book.</p>
