            <p> I was reading a book, a history book, and there was a part that mentioned a mayor. Well she won the <a href="stickers.html">mayoral election</a> but then turned down the position. But the whole thing was funny, because she was the only resident of the town. So, when she declined the position she was just living with no government. Still, I guess she was self-governed, and anyway she made it into this history book. </p>
